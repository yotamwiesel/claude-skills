# Strategic Paid Advertising Plan

## Process

### 1. Discovery
- Business type, products/services, target audience
- Current advertising status (active platforms, spend, performance)
- Goals: brand awareness, lead generation, e-commerce sales, app installs
- Budget range (monthly/quarterly)
- Timeline and urgency
- In-house team capacity vs agency needs

### 2. Competitive Analysis
- Identify top 3-5 competitors
- Analyze their ad presence across platforms (Google Ads Transparency, Meta Ad Library)
- Estimate competitor spend levels and platform mix
- Identify messaging themes and creative approaches
- Note keyword/audience gaps (opportunities competitors are missing)

### 3. Platform Selection
- Load industry template from `assets/` directory
- Match business type to recommended platform mix
- Read `ads/references/budget-allocation.md` for platform selection matrix
- Read `ads/references/conversion-tracking.md` for tracking setup requirements
- Assess platform fit based on:
  - Target audience demographics per platform
  - Product/service type suitability
  - Budget requirements per platform (minimums)
  - Sales cycle length and attribution needs
  - Creative capabilities and content availability

### 4. Campaign Architecture

#### Naming Convention
```
[Platform]_[Objective]_[Audience]_[Geo]_[Date]
```
Example: `META_CONV_Prospecting_US_2026Q1`

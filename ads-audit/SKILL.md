# Full Multi-Platform Ads Audit

## Process

1. **Collect account data**: request exports, screenshots, or API access
2. **Validate**: confirm at least one platform's data is available before proceeding
3. **Detect business type**: analyze account signals per ads orchestrator
4. **Identify active platforms**: determine which platforms are in use
5. **Delegate to subagents** (if available, otherwise run inline sequentially):
   - `audit-google`: Conversion tracking, wasted spend, structure, keywords, ads, settings (G01-G74)
   - `audit-meta`: Pixel/CAPI health, creative fatigue, structure, audience (M01-M46)
   - `audit-creative`: LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft creative checks + cross-platform synthesis
   - `audit-tracking`: LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft tracking + cross-platform tracking health
   - `audit-budget`: LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft budget/bidding + cross-platform allocation
   - `audit-compliance`: All-platform compliance, settings, performance benchmarks
6. **Validate**: verify each subagent returned valid scores with required fields before aggregating
7. **Score**: calculate per-platform and aggregate Ads Health Score (0-100)
8. **Report**: generate prioritized action plan with Quick Wins

## Data Collection

Ask the user for available data. Accept any combination:
- Google Ads: account export, Change History, Search Terms Report
- Meta Ads: Ads Manager export, Events Manager screenshot, EMQ scores
- LinkedIn Ads: Campaign Manager export, Insight Tag status
- TikTok Ads: Ads Manager export, Pixel/Events API status
- Microsoft Ads: account export, UET tag status, import validation results

If no exports available, audit from screenshots or manual data entry.

- **Low**: Best practice, minor impact (backlog)

## Quick Wins Criteria

```
IF severity == "Critical" OR severity == "High"
AND estimated_fix_time < 15 minutes
THEN flag as Quick Win
SORT BY (severity_multiplier x estimated_impact) DESC
```

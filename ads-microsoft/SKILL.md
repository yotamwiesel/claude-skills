# Microsoft Ads Deep Analysis

## Process

1. Collect Microsoft Ads data (account export, UET tag status, import results)
2. Read `ads/references/microsoft-audit.md` for full 24-check audit
3. Read `ads/references/benchmarks.md` for Microsoft-specific benchmarks
4. Read `ads/references/scoring-system.md` for weighted scoring
5. Evaluate all applicable checks as PASS, WARNING, or FAIL
6. Calculate Microsoft Ads Health Score (0-100)
7. Generate findings report with action plan

## What to Analyze

### Technical Setup (25% weight)
- UET tag installed and firing on all pages (MS01)
- Enhanced conversions enabled (MS02)
- Google Ads import validated: URLs, extensions, bids, goals (MS03)

### Syndication & Bidding (20% weight)
- Search partner network reviewed, low-performers excluded (MS04)
- Audience Network enabled only if testing intentionally (MS05)
- Bid targets 20-35% lower than Google (CPC advantage) (MS06)
- PMax: 300 campaigns/account (vs 100 Google), LinkedIn profile data available, no video support
- Target New Customers enabled for PMax, Beta 2026 (MS07)

### Campaign Structure (20% weight)
- Campaign structure mirrors Google or follows best practices (MS08)
- Budget proportional to Bing volume: typically 20-30% of Google (MS09)
- LinkedIn profile targeting for B2B (unique advantage) (MS10)

### Creative & Extensions (20% weight)
- RSA: ≥8 headlines, ≥3 descriptions (MS11)
- Multimedia Ads tested (unique rich format) (MS12)
- Ad copy optimized for Bing demographics (MS13)
- Action Extension utilized (unique to Microsoft) (MS19)
- Filter Link Extension tested (MS20)

### Settings & Performance (15% weight)
- Copilot chat placement enabled for PMax: 73% CTR lift (MS14)
- Conversion goals configured natively, not relying on imported (MS15)
- CPC 20-40% lower than Google for same keywords (MS16)
- CVR comparable to Google, not >50% lower (MS17)
- Impression share tracked for brand and top terms (MS18)

## Google Import Validation

Most Microsoft Ads accounts start as Google Ads imports. Critical validation:

### What Transfers Correctly
- Campaign structure and ad groups
- Keywords and match types
- RSA headlines and descriptions
- Basic bid strategies

### What Needs Manual Review
- **URLs**: verify all landing page URLs are correct post-import
- **Extensions**: not all Google extensions have Microsoft equivalents
- **Bid amounts**: should be 20-35% lower (don't import Google bids as-is)
- **Conversion goals**: re-create natively for better tracking
- **Audiences**: import may miss segments, verify all are present
- **Negative keywords**: verify shared negative lists transferred

### Import Schedule
- Auto-import: useful but review changes monthly
- **Warning:** Scheduled imports can re-enable paused campaigns. Deactivate scheduled imports after initial setup.
- Manual import: more control, recommended for large accounts
- Never import without post-import audit

## Copilot Integration

Microsoft's AI assistant creates unique ad opportunities:

### Copilot Chat Ads
- Available in Performance Max campaigns
- 73% CTR lift reported in chat placement
- Copilot Checkout launched Jan 2026 (in-chat purchase)
- Natural language ad delivery (conversational context)
- Copilot ads show beneath AI responses with Sponsored labels

### How to Evaluate
- Is Copilot placement enabled? (If not, HIGH priority for PMax)
- What % of impressions/clicks come from Copilot?
- CTR/CVR comparison: Copilot vs traditional placements
- Ad copy quality: does it read well in conversational context?

## Microsoft-Unique Features

These features are exclusive to Microsoft Ads; evaluate adoption:

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| CTV Ads | Netflix, Max, Hulu, Roku, discovery+. 30-second non-skippable. | Medium |
| Multimedia Ads | Image-rich search ads with visual elements | Medium |
| Action Extension | CTA button directly in search ad | Medium |

| Auto-generated RSA | Enabled by default Jan 2026, 5% CTR increase | Medium |
| 9:16 Vertical Video | Vertical video ads (Apr 2025), 90-second max duration | Medium |

## Bing Demographic Context

Microsoft Ads reach a distinct audience:
- Older demographic (35-65+ over-indexed)
- Higher household income (top 25% income brackets)
- Desktop-heavy (Windows default browser = Edge = Bing)
- Enterprise/corporate users (Office 365 integration)

Ad copy optimization for this audience:
- Professional tone, less casual than Google/Meta
- Emphasize quality, reliability, premium positioning
- Desktop-optimized landing pages matter more
- B2B messaging resonates strongly

## Key Thresholds

| Metric | Pass | Warning | Fail |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| CTR (Search) | ≥2.83% | 1.5-2.83% | <1.5% |
| CPC (Search) | ≤$1.55 | $1.55-2.50 | >$2.50 |
| CPC vs Google | 20-40% lower | 10-20% lower | Same or higher |
| CVR vs Google | Within 20% | 20-50% lower | >50% lower |
| Impression share (brand) | ≥80% | 60-80% | <60% |

# Cross-Platform Creative Quality Audit

## Process

1. Collect creative assets or performance data from active platforms
2. Read `ads/references/platform-specs.md` for creative specifications
3. Read `ads/references/benchmarks.md` for CTR/engagement benchmarks
4. Read `ads/references/scoring-system.md` for weighted scoring algorithm
5. **Validate**: confirm at least one platform has creative data (assets or performance metrics) before proceeding
6. Evaluate creative quality per platform
7. Assess cross-platform creative consistency
8. **Validate**: verify fatigue signals reference actual performance trends, not assumptions
9. Generate production priority recommendations

| Meta | Every 14-21 days |
| LinkedIn | Every 4-6 weeks |
| Google Search | Every 8-12 weeks |

## Andromeda Creative Similarity Score (Meta)

Meta's Andromeda engine (launched October 2025) clusters ads with >60% similarity and suppresses delivery
of near-identical creatives. 100 minor variations (color swaps, small text changes)
perform no better than 10 genuinely distinct creatives. Evaluate:
- Are creatives genuinely diverse in concept, angle, and format?
- Flag accounts relying on iterative variations rather than distinct concepts
- Recommend testing fundamentally different hooks, formats, and value propositions

## Symphony Automation Awareness (TikTok, 2025)

TikTok's Symphony AI (2025) generates creative variations from product URLs. Assess:
- Whether account uses AI-generated vs original creatives
- Quality and performance comparison of Symphony vs manual creatives
- Impact on creative refresh strategy (Symphony can accelerate iteration)

## Universal Creative Best Practices

### Cross-Platform Safe Zone
- 900x1000px usable area works across all vertical placements
- Keep critical elements centered and within safe margins
- Test on mobile devices (75%+ of ad impressions are mobile)

### Ad Copy Principles
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Include clear CTA (what should they do next?)
- Match ad message to landing page (message match)
- Use numbers and specifics over vague claims
- Test emotional vs rational appeals

### Video Production Standards
- H.264 codec, AAC audio, MP4 container
- Minimum 720p (1080p preferred)
- Subtitles/captions always (accessibility + sound-off viewing)
- Brand mention within first 5s (awareness) or at CTA (performance)

# Ads Photoshoot: AI Product Photography

Transforms a product image or description into professional ad-ready photography
in 5 distinct visual styles. Each style generates at two sizes: 1:1 (Meta/LinkedIn)
and 9:16 (TikTok/Reels/Stories).

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ads photoshoot` | Interactive: ask for product + styles |
| `/ads photoshoot --styles studio floating` | Generate only selected styles |
| `/ads photoshoot --product shoe.jpg` | Start with a product image file |
| `/ads photoshoot --all-platforms` | Generate all 5 sizes per style |

## Environment Setup

Requires banana-claude (v1.4.1+) with nanobanana-mcp configured.
Run `/banana setup` to configure API key and MCP.

## Process

### Step 1: Collect Product Information

Ask (combine into one message):
1. **Product image**: Path to product image file (local) OR product URL OR text description
   > "Provide a product image path (e.g. ./product.jpg), a URL, or describe your product"
2. **Product description**: What is it? Key features to highlight? (helps prompt quality)
3. **Styles to generate**: Which of the 5 styles? (default: all 5)
   - Studio, Floating, Ingredient, In Use, Lifestyle
4. **Target platforms**: Which platforms will these run on?
   - Determines output sizes (default: Meta + TikTok → 1:1 + 9:16)

### Step 2: Load Brand Profile (Optional)

Check for `brand-profile.json` in the current directory.

If found, extract for style injection:
- `colors.primary` → inject into backgrounds and accent elements
- `aesthetic.mood_keywords` → inject as atmosphere descriptors
- `target_audience` → use for Lifestyle and In Use context
- `imagery.forbidden` → exclude from all prompts

If not found, proceed with standard style templates.

### Step 3: Verify banana-claude

Verify banana-claude is installed (run `/banana setup` to check). If not installed,
display setup instructions and exit.

### Step 4: Construct Prompts per Style

For each selected style, build the prompt using the template + product description + brand DNA.

#### Style 1: Studio
Clean, e-commerce style product shot.

**Base template:**
```
"[product description], professional product photography, clean white seamless
background, even studio lighting, soft drop shadow, high detail product focus,
ecommerce style, [brand.colors.primary] subtle accent reflections if applicable,
top-down or 3/4 angle, no distractions, catalog quality"
```

**Composition:** Centered, slight 3/4 angle or flat lay.
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080, 1080×1920

#### Style 2: Floating
Dramatic levitation effect.

**Base template:**
```
"[product description] floating in mid-air, dramatic floating product shot,
[brand.colors.primary or brand.aesthetic.mood_keywords[0]] gradient background,
atmospheric shadow below product, levitation effect, product defying gravity,
clean modern aesthetic, high contrast, striking visual"
```

**Composition:** Product centered vertically, ample space above and below.
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080, 1080×1920

#### Style 3: Ingredient
Flat lay with components.

**Base template:**
```
"[product description] centered flat lay, surrounded by its key ingredients
or materials artfully arranged, top-down overhead view, clean light background,
natural texture surface, product as hero element, ingredients scattered with
intentional negative space, editorial food photography style"
```

**Composition:** Top-down, product in center, ingredients fanning out.
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080 (optimal for this style). Also generate 9:16 vertical for TikTok/Reels/Stories placements.

#### Style 4: In Use
Authentic usage context.

**Base template:**
```
"person's hands using [product description] in natural context, lifestyle
photography, focus on product-hand interaction, shallow depth of field,
warm natural window light, authentic not staged, [brand.target_audience.profession]
implied context, [brand.aesthetic.mood_keywords] atmosphere"
```

**Composition:** Hands prominent, product clearly identifiable, background soft-focus.
**Note:** Hands only; no full face (avoids model release complications).
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080, 1080×1920

#### Style 5: Lifestyle
Aspirational full-context shot.

**Base template:**
```
"[product description] in aspirational lifestyle scene, [brand.target_audience.age_range]
demographic implied environment, [brand.target_audience.profession] context,
[brand.aesthetic.mood_keywords] atmosphere, golden hour or clean natural lighting,
editorial photography style, [brand.aesthetic.negative_space] composition,
product clearly visible and prominent"
```

**Composition:** Environmental context, product as hero element within the scene.
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080, 1080×1920

### Iterative Refinement

For iterative refinement: if initial generation doesn't match brand expectations, adjust the prompt by specifying: lighting direction, color temperature, background texture, or product angle before regenerating.

### Step 5: Generate Images

**Domain mode selection per style:**
- Use banana **Product** mode for Studio, Floating, and Ingredient styles
- Use banana **Editorial** mode for In Use and Lifestyle styles
- Set resolution to 2K (default) for all generations

**Aspect ratio setup:** Use banana MCP `set_aspect_ratio` before each generation:
- For 1080x1080: set ratio to 1:1
- For 1080x1920: set ratio to 9:16

For each style x size combination, use `/banana generate` with the constructed
prompt, selected domain mode, and correct aspect ratio. Save output to
`./product-photos/[style]/[product-slug]-[style]-[WxH].png`.

Track results. If a generation fails, retry once with a simplified prompt.

### Step 6: Organize and Report

**Output directory structure:**
```
./product-photos/
  studio/
    product-studio-1080x1080.png
    product-studio-1080x1920.png
  floating/
    product-floating-1080x1080.png
    product-floating-1080x1920.png
  ingredient/
    product-ingredient-1080x1080.png
    product-ingredient-1080x1920.png
  in-use/
    product-in-use-1080x1080.png
    product-in-use-1080x1920.png
  lifestyle/
    product-lifestyle-1080x1080.png
    product-lifestyle-1080x1920.png
```
